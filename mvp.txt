🧱 Core MVP Components
1. User Interface (Frontend)
Simple, step-by-step input flow:

Demographics: Age, gender, known conditions.

Timeline: When symptoms began, progression.

Current symptoms (structured + free text).

Uploaded docs (optional for now, maybe later).

Dashboard shows:

Top 3–5 possible diagnoses (common + rare).

Layperson explanation for each.

“Questions to ask your doctor.”

“Tests often associated with this condition.”

🛠️ Tech: React / Flutter / Swift (depending on target)

2. Inference Engine (Backend)
This is where your real value sits.

a. LLM Layer
Use GPT-4 (or Claude, or Mistral) to:

Interpret free-text symptom descriptions.

Convert into structured form: [symptom, duration, severity, progression].

Generate natural-language summaries and explanations.

b. Diagnosis Reasoning Layer
Match symptoms to possible conditions using:

Public datasets like:

Orphanet (rare diseases)

UMLS, SNOMED CT

PubMed abstracts (for validation)

Use rules + scoring logic (e.g., Bayesian or heuristic-based matching).

Optionally fine-tune or prompt LLM with case study patterns.

c. Suggestion Engine
Based on likely diagnoses:

Suggest next-step tests (e.g., “ANA panel”, “MRI brain”).

Suggest specific questions (“Could this be autoimmune?”, “Has MS been ruled out?”).

🛠️ Tech: Python (FastAPI or Flask), vector store (e.g., FAISS), LLM API (OpenAI/GPT-4 or similar)

3. Database
Store:

User sessions (symptoms, results, feedback).

Mapped medical terms (SNOMED IDs, disease metadata).

Diagnostic “playbooks” for common/rare diseases.

🛠️ Tech: PostgreSQL + embedding DB (for semantically searching symptoms)

4. Basic Feedback Loop
Ask: “Was this helpful?” / “Was a diagnosis eventually made?”

Use this over time to refine the accuracy (start simple, don’t overfit).

🧪 Example User Flow
"My sister has had recurring fevers, joint pain, and fatigue for 3 months. Doctors checked for infections but found nothing. She's 28."

User inputs:

Age, gender, key symptoms, duration.

Notes that infections ruled out.

DeepDiagnosis responds:

Possible conditions: Lupus (SLE), Adult-onset Still's Disease, Lyme disease (late stage).

Explains why each could match.

Suggests: ANA test, inflammatory markers, “Ask if autoimmune workup has been done.”

User can export or screenshot this for their next appointment.

🚀 MVP Timeline Estimate (Lean Team)
Task	Time (est.)

✅ How to Differentiate
Rare diseases as first-class citizens.

Language designed for non-medical users.

Empowerment: "What could this be? What should we ask?"
